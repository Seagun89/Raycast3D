# Raycast3D
A video game project where I am learning about the creation of raycasting, video game development and practicing C++ OOP. 
Within this repo I use the programming language of C++ and utilize the library Raylib. 
The reason I went with Raylib is because I also began using Linux Ubuntu as my main OS and booting it up from a VM.
OpenGL wasn't compatible with Linux thus I had to find a way to use an openGL like framework and Raylib was that answer.
